## ML Model Deployment Project
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Statsmodels, SciPy, LabelEncoder, RandomForestClassifier, DecisionTreeClassifier, Hyperparameter Tuning, Excel

### Description:
1. Data Handling:
* Loaded and inspected datasets with Pandas to understand data structure and content.
* Merged datasets using inner join to ensure no null values and to maintain data integrity.
* Performed data cleaning by identifying and removing rows with -99999 values, treating them as nulls.
* Addressed missing values and duplicates, ensuring clean and reliable data for model training.

2. Descriptive Analysis:
* Conducted descriptive statistics and visualized data distributions to understand underlying patterns and relationships.
* Applied hypothesis testing to check for cardinality or co-linearity in categorical features using Chi-Square, T-test, and ANOVA tests.

3. Feature Engineering:
* Selected features based on hypothesis testing results and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) to minimize multicollinearity.
* Performed one-hot encoding on categorical variables and label encoding on ordered categorical data for model compatibility.

4. Model Training and Evaluation:
* Trained and evaluated multiple models: Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier.
* Achieved highest accuracy with XGBoost Classifier at 0.78, followed by Random Forest at 0.76 and Decision Tree at 0.71.
* Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores for each class.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
* Fine-tuned the XGBoost model by performing grid search over a range of hyperparameters.
* Iteratively trained and evaluated models to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters.

6.Deployment Preparation:
* Applied the tuned XGBoost model to an unseen dataset for final prediction.
* Saved the final predictions to an Excel file for easy access and review.

7. Runtime Calculation:
* Implemented runtime measurement to ensure efficient execution, crucial for deployment scenarios.
